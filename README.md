# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
In this project I have taken a toy dataset to implemented Ridge regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent to learn 
the coefficients. I also tested it against the results obtained from SGD regression, Linear regression and Ridge regression 
functions defined in scikit-learn Machine Learning library.
